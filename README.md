# Robot Tracking Data Set
A dataset for evaluating end-effector tracking accuracy.

Released as part of the paper "Probabilistic Articulated Real-Time Tracking for Robot Manipulation", 
by Cristina Garcia Cifuentes, Jan Issac, Manuel WÃ¼thrich, Stefan Schaal and Jeannette Bohg in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 2016.

The repository is currently hosted [here](https://git-amd.tuebingen.mpg.de/open-source/hand_tracking_dataset/wikis/home).
You may email any questions to [Cristina](https://am.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/ccifuentes).

The below pictures show three samples of the dataset. Sequences contain situations with slow to fast robot arm as well as camera motion and none to very severe, long-term occlusions.
